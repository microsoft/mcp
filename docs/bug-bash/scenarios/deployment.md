# 🚀 Deployment Scenarios Testing

> **⚠️ MCP Tool Support Notice**
> Azure MCP Server provides **deployment planning guidance, CI/CD pipeline recommendations, and application log retrieval** capabilities. Actual resource creation and application deployment require Azure CLI, Portal, or CI/CD tools. This scenario guides you through complete end-to-end workflows, clearly marking when to use MCP tools vs external tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Test deployment planning and guidance from Azure MCP Server
- Verify CI/CD pipeline recommendation accuracy
- Test application log retrieval and analysis
- Validate deployment plan generation for various project types

## ✅ Prerequisites

- [ ] Azure MCP Server installed and configured
- [ ] Azure CLI installed (`az --version`)
- [ ] Azure Developer CLI installed (`azd version`)
- [ ] Authenticated to Azure (`az login`)
- [ ] Active Azure subscription
- [ ] GitHub Copilot with Agent mode enabled

## 📋 Scenario 1: Application Deployment Planning End-to-End

**Objective**: Complete workflow for getting deployment guidance and executing deployment

### Step 1: Setup Sample Application (Local - Not MCP)

> **External Setup Required**: Create a sample Node.js application locally

```bash
# Create a sample Node.js application
mkdir bugbash-deploy-app && cd bugbash-deploy-app

# Initialize Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install Express
npm install express

# Create simple server (index.js)
cat > index.js << 'EOF'
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Azure!', timestamp: new Date() });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
EOF

# Create package.json start script
npm pkg set scripts.start="node index.js"
```

### Step 2: Get Deployment Plan with Azure MCP Server

- ✅ CI/CD pipeline recommendations comprehensive
- ✅ Application logs successfully retrieved
- ✅ Architecture diagram generated correctly

cat > frontend/package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "version": "1.0.0",

## � Common Issues to Watch For

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Invalid Workspace Path** | Workspace folder not found | Verify the workspace folder path exists and is accessible |
| **Project Not Recognized** | MCP can't identify project type | Ensure package.json or project files exist in the folder |
| **Missing Dependencies** | Required project files missing | Check project structure has all necessary configuration files |
| **IaC Tool Mismatch** | Wrong provisioning tool recommended | Specify preferred tool (Bicep/Terraform) in the prompt |
| **Log Retrieval Fails** | Can't access application logs | Verify azd environment exists and is properly configured |
| **Architecture Diagram Errors** | Diagram generation fails | Ensure application topology is properly defined |
| **Pipeline Guidance Generic** | Recommendations too generic | Provide more context about your project structure and requirements |
