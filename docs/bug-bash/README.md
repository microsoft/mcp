## Introduction

The Azure MCP Server enables AI agents to interact with Azure services through natural language commands. As we continue to enhance the server, we need your help to identify issues across different platforms, IDEs, and usage scenarios.

This bug bash focuses on:
- **Multi-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Installation and setup** across different IDEs and package managers
- **Resource discovery and inspection** - testing how well MCP finds and retrieves information
- **Querying capabilities** - testing database queries and data retrieval
- **Monitoring and diagnostics** - testing log/metric access and health checks
- **Deployment guidance** - testing how MCP helps plan and guide deployments
- **Authentication** across different environments
- **End-to-end scenarios** that developers commonly encounter

## Bug Bash Goals

The primary goals of this bug bash are to:

1. **Exercise real-world scenarios** - Run through common developer workflows
2. **Validate cross-platform compatibility** - Ensure the server works reliably on Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. **Verify installation experience** - Test installation across VS Code, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA
4. **Assess performance** - Monitor memory consumption and CPU usage under typical workloads
5. **Validate authentication** - Ensure auth works consistently across all platforms
6. **Test server modes** - Verify single, namespace, and all modes work as expected
7. **Validate feature flags** - Test enabling/disabling server features

## What to Test

We encourage you to test the following areas:

### Platform Testing
- [ ] **Windows** - Test on Windows 11
- [ ] **macOS** - Test on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- [ ] **Linux** - Test on Ubuntu, Fedora, or other distributions

### IDE Installation
- [ ] **VS Code** - Stable and Insiders versions
- [ ] **Visual Studio 2022** - Community, Professional, or Enterprise
- [ ] **IntelliJ IDEA** - Ultimate or Community editions (2025.2+)
- [ ] **Claude Desktop** - macOS and Windows
- [ ] **Cursor** - AI-first code editor
- [ ] **Windsurf** - Codeium Cascade editor
- [ ] **Amazon Q Developer** - AWS IDE integration
- [ ] **Claude Code** - Web-based Claude interface

### Performance Monitoring

**How to Monitor Performance:**

**Windows:**
- Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
- Find `azmcp.exe` process
- Monitor Memory and CPU columns during operations

**macOS:**
- Open Activity Monitor (Applications → Utilities → Activity Monitor)
- Search for `azmcp` process
- Monitor CPU % and Memory columns

**Linux:**
- Use `htop` or `top` command
- Filter for `azmcp` process
- Monitor %CPU and RES (memory) columns

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Monitor **memory consumption** during typical operations
- [ ] Monitor **CPU usage** during command execution
- [ ] Test with **multiple concurrent operations**
- [ ] Observe behavior during **long-running sessions** (2+ hours):
  - Memory usage trends (stable, growing, or leaking)
  - Server responsiveness (does it slow down over time?)
  - Error frequency (do errors increase with time?)
- [ ] Record baseline memory usage at startup
- [ ] Check for memory leaks after extended use

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Test **Azure CLI authentication** (`az login`)
- [ ] Test **Azure PowerShell authentication** (`Connect-AzAccount`)
- [ ] Test **Interactive browser authentication** - Set `AZURE_MCP_ONLY_USE_BROKER_CREDENTIAL=true` and sign in through the broker/browser when innvoking tools via Azure MCP Server. See [Authentication Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/Authentication.md#authentication-fundamentals) for details.
- [ ] Test authentication across **multiple tenants** - Switch between different Azure AD tenants

### Server Mode Testing

See [Server Mode Testing](https://github.com/g2vinay/mcp/tree/add-bug-bash-docs/docs/bug-bash/installation-testing.md#server-mode-testing) for detailed instructions.

- [ ] **Namespace mode** (default) - Tools grouped by Azure service (~40-50 tools)
- [ ] **All mode** - All tools exposed individually (100+ tools)
- [ ] **Single mode** - Single unified tool with internal routing
- [ ] **Read-only mode** - Blocks all write/destructive operations
- [ ] **Namespace filtering** - Expose specific services only (e.g., storage, keyvault)

### Feature Flag Testing
- [ ] Enable/disable server
- [ ] Test read-only mode
- [ ] Test with different namespace configurations
- [ ] Test tool filtering
