Additional. Containerization:
    - If Dockerfiles exist, list their paths.
    - If missing: Create dockerfiles for each application/service.
        - Define a valid base image based on the project's language.
        - Copy the required files into the container.
        - Set the working directory.
        - Install dependencies and build the project.
        - Expose the listening ports.
        - Define an entrypoint
        - Create .dockerignore if required.
    - Ensure the dockerfiles can be built using 'docker build'. Keep track of each dockerfile created, and its required docker build context path. Agent must create Dockerfile first before deployment!
    - Output: Docker artifacts
