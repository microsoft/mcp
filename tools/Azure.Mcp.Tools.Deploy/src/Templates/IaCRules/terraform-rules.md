- Expected files: main.tf, main.tfvars.json (with the minimally required parameters), outputs.tf.
- Resource names should use Azure CAF naming convention. This is required for deployments. Add aztfmod/azurecaf in the required provider. DO NOT use random_length. NO suffixes needed.
- Avoid duplicate definitions across all Terraform files (e.g., main.tf and variables.tf).
- Configure subscription ID for azurerm provider.
