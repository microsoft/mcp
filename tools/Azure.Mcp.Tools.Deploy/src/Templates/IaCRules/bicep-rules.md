- Expected files: main.bicep, main.parameters.json (with parameters from main.bicep).
- Resource token format: 'uniqueString(subscription().id, resourceGroup().id, location, environmentName)' (scope = resourceGroup) or 'uniqueString(subscription().id, location, environmentName)' (scope = subscription).
- All resources should be named like az{resourcePrefix}{resourceToken}, where resourcePrefix is a prefix for the resource (ex. 'kv' for key vault) and <= 3 characters. Alphanumeric only. ResourceToken is the string generated by uniqueString as per earlier. Apply this to ALL resources as well as newly written resources.
