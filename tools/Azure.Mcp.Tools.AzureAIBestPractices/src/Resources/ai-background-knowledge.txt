## Background Knowledge
### Understanding AI Models Hierarchy
#### Knowledge
1. Model Provider: The company/organization providing the model (e.g., OpenAI, Microsoft, Deepseek, Meta)
2. Model Series: A family of related models (e.g., gpt-5, gpt-4o, deepseek-v3, llama-3)
3. Model: Specific variants within a series (e.g., gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-chat within the gpt-5 series)

#### Where to use

### Microsoft Agent Framework Key Features
#### Knowledge
**Microsoft Agent Framework** is the recommended SDK for building AI agents with Azure. It provides:

**Core Capabilities:**
  - **Flexible Agent Framework**: Build, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents and multi-agent systems
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Available for both .NET and Python
  - **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Microsoft Foundry, and other providers

**Agent Types:**
  - **[RECOMMENDED] Microsoft Foundry Agent (`PersistentAgentsClient`)**: Service-managed persistent agents with conversation threads - best for production applications requiring conversation continuity
  - **OpenAI ChatCompletion / Responses / Assistants Agent (`OpenAIClient`)**: Stateless or service-managed agents using OpenAI service
  - **Microsoft Foundry Models ChatCompletion / Responses Agent (`OpenAIClient` / `AzureOpenAIClient`)**: For testing Foundry-deployed models (stateless)
  - **Azure OpenAI ChatCompletion / Responses (`AzureOpenAIClient`)**: Stateless agents using Azure OpenAI ChatCompletion / Responses service  
  - **Advanced & Custom Agents**: Custom agents, A2A proxy agents, Any IChatClient
  
**Agent Features:**
  - **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintain context across messages with conversation threading using `AgentThread`
  - **Function Tools**: Call external functions and APIs to extend agent capabilities
  - **Multimodal Support**: Handle text, vision, and other input types
  - **Structured Output**: Generate JSON or strongly-typed object responses
  - **Human-in-the-loop**: Require user approval for sensitive operations

**Workflow Features:** (For Multi-Agent Systems):
  - **Sequential**: Process tasks one after another
  - **Concurrent**: Run multiple agents in parallel
  - **Handoff**: Pass control between agents dynamically
  - **Magentic**: Advanced group chat orchestration
  - **Agents in workflows**: Embed agents as workflow steps
  - **Workflow branching logic**: Conditional routing based on results
  - **Checkpointing and resuming**: Save and restore workflow state

**Advanced Agent Features**:
  - **Middleware**: Intercept/modify requests/responses
  - **Memory**: Retain information across conversations
  - **Observability**: OpenTelemetry tracing
  - **Agent as tool**: Use agents as functions
  - **Persisting conversations**: Store chat history
  - **Third-party storage**: Custom storage backends
  - **Structured output**: Generate JSON/object responses
  - **Agent types**: Azure OpenAI, Foundry, custom

**Integration Features:**:
  - **MCP tools**: Model Context Protocol integration
  - **MCP with Foundry Agents**: MCP + Microsoft Foundry
  - **Request and response handling**: External API integration
  - **Shared states**: Pass data between executors
  - **Visualization**: Visual workflow representations
