# Contributing to Template Model Context Protocol (MCP) VS Code Extension

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Template MCP extension for Visual Studio Code!

## Building and Installation

You need to have `Node.js`, `npm` and `powershell` installed. Node 20 (LTS) or later is recommended for development.

1. **Build the VSIX file containing the extension**
    ```powershell
    ./eng/scripts/New-BuildInfo.ps1
    ./eng/scripts/Build-Code.ps1 -Server Template.Mcp.Server
    ./eng/scripts/Pack-Vsix.ps1 -Server Template.Mcp.Server
    ```
2. **Install the extension into VS Code**
    Open VS Code Extensions view, click on the "..." menu and choose "Install from VSIX...". Point to the VSIX file created in step 1.

## Debugging

To debug extension code, use the "Run Extension" debug configuration provided in the `launch.json` file in the repo. This configuration will (re)build the extension as necessaryâ€”no need to build anything manually.

## Submitting a Change

Before submitting a PR, make sure that the unit tests pass (`npm run unit-test`) and that the code linter does not produce any errors or warnings (`npm run lint`).

You might find [ESLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) handy for keeping the code error-free as you are making changes.

## Legal
